THANKS for downloading Funkin' MINECRAFT!

It's a MINECRAFT-themed mod to the Friday Night Funkin' Rhythm Game.




NOTE: The application doesn't have a certificate! I'm too broke for code signing.


Q: I'm not an administrator, so I don't have permission to run the game!

A: You can play the web version: itz-miles.github.io/Funkin-MINECRAFT
